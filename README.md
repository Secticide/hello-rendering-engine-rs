# Hello Rendering Engine: Rust Edition

Hello Rendering Engine is a Rust version of the [HelloRenderingEngine](https://github.com/ojrosten/HelloRenderingEngine) project by [Oliver Rosten](https://github.com/ojrosten). Similarly to the project it is based on; it is intended to be an introduction to OpenGL, realtime computer graphics and idiomatic Rust (as appoosed to modern C++).

## Getting Started

I thought I would include a getting started section to make it easy to get Rust installed and run the project.

Step by step:
1. Download and install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
2. Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (IDE of choice for Rust)
3. Install the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) VSCode extension
4. Use the following commands to pull and run the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/Secticide/hello-rendering-engine-rs.git
cd hello-rendering-engine-rs
cargo run
```

## Additional Lecture Notes

When translating the lecture content over to Rust, some of the lectures have brought up several options for how to tackle the problems surfaced. The following is a listing of the notes made for specific lectures:
- [Lecture 7: Variadic Generics](NOTES.md#lecture-7-variadic-generics)

## Links and Resources

If you're interested in learning Rust, reading the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a great starting point!
